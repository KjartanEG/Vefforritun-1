    <h2>Chapter I — How many kinds of principalities there are, and by <br>what means they are acquired</h2>
        All states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been and are either republics or <br>
        principalities. <br>
        <br>
        Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long established; or they are new. <br>
        <br>
        The new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or they are, as it were, members  <br>
        annexed to the hereditary state of the prince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to <br>
        that of the King of Spain. <br>
        <br>
    
         Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a prince, or to live in freedom; and <br>
         are acquired either by the arms of the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.
         <br>
    <h2>Chapter II — Concerning hereditary principalities</h2>
        I will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another place I have written of them at <br>
        length, and will address myself only to principalities. In doing so I will keep to the order indicated <br>
        above, and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved. <br>
        <br>
        I say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states, and those long accustomed to the <br>
        of their prince, than new ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of his <br>
        ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, for a prince of average powers to <br>
        maintain himself in his state, unless he be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and <br>
        if he should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the usurper, he will regain it.<br>
        <br>    
        We have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have withstood the attacks of the <br>
        Venetians in '84, nor those of Pope Julius in '10, unless he had been long established in his dominions. <br>
        For the hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it happens that he will be <br>
        more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his <br>
        subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and duration of his rule the <br>
        memories and motives that make for change are lost, for one change always leaves the toothing for <br>
        another.<br>
